# Integrating Network Optimization for Enhanced Traffic Engineering

CSE 534 Final Project Codebase: Avinda De Silva

All working files can be found in the `traffic-engineering` directory

The `GNN.ipynb` file is an extended version of the LSTM model using Adadelta optimization

The `Shortest-Path.ipynb` file is how the A-star search shortest path algorithm is run after the graph structure has been created

The `Fabric_setup_and_data_collection.ipynb` file is where the network structure is created as well as where the data is collected

The modified data files including all relevant data can be found in `traffic-engineering/data`

The `setup_adaptive_video.ipynb` file is from Lab 2 demonstrating how to run the Bitrate test to get the required bitrate data.
